- Android Project Idea: Expense monitoring solutions are extremely useful for people who have a tight budget but have a difficult time sticking to it. It may be ideal for children, as they have no choice over how they spend their money. This assignment will assist them in keeping track of where they have spent money and how much they have spent. It will also determine the overall expenses incurred thus far.
- The Android Studio IDE with Kotlin Programming and XML is required for the development of this project. SQLite can be used to store the database locally on the Android smartphone. SQLite was created exclusively for Android application development.
- The user would first have to register with the app before being able to use it. They can also select a target amount that they do not wish to spend, and this technique will greatly assist them.
